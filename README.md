# CAMP
A Yelp-esque Campsite application

Current Features Include:
- Users can register and login
- Users can create their own campground pages
  - Users can also edit the campground pages they created (authentication is processed; If you are identified as the creator,
  you will be able to edit the page, otherwise you will be redirected)
- Users can comment and rate campground pages
  - Users can edit and delete their own comments (authentication works similarly to the above here)
